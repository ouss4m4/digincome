Everyone can run a campaign on their favorite advertisement platform. and start bringing people to their landing page. other affiliates relie on SEO to bring organic traffic.

but only few visitors turn to a client. the majority does not **Convert**. because the landing page did not sell them.

i am talking precisely about affiliate marketing landing pages. because they go wrong easily. one malformed heading will send the visitor away.

## What are landing pages?

When a visitor clicks on your ad (for example, a Google ad or facebook ad). he will be redirected to your website. the first page he sees is called a Landing Page.

Specific landing pages tailored to different offers are essential for providing a quality experience for visitors and driving conversions with a targeted message that matches each user’s need

## What makes a “good” landing page?

Marketers have tons of creative freedom when it comes to putting together their landing pages.

However, we've identified some common threads among high-performing pages, which we've highlighted below.

**A good landing page guides visitors from Point A to Point B**

Ideally, your landing page should keep visitors reading (and scrolling) as they naturally want to learn more and eventually click through your call-to-action (CTA).

**A good landing page isn't cluttered.**

The rule of thumb for landing pages is "less is more." When it comes to copy and color schemes, you'll notice that many of them are minimalists, using only a few colors and short copy to make their offer easy to digest at a glance.

Before creating the landing page, i usually answer the following questions. and try to see it from different angles. not all offers are equal. try to find the perfect fit for the product.

## 1. Who is my audience

<!-- https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/02/12/great-landing-pages -->

by the time you reach the landing page creation step. i suppose you have already selected a product. and did your research. one part of the research is knowing your audience.

do it again when creating a landing page. who is my audience ?

the better you understand your audience, the more you can answer to their questions.

Unless you know who your ideal customers are, it will be very difficult to write content they are interested in ! and keep them on the page.

## 2.What is my goal?

what is the goal of your page? what is the one thing your visitor has to do. for you to get a commission, a sale, or an email. this is what we call a Conversion .

- i need the visitor to click on my CTA -Call To Action-
- Buy a product ? if it's a presell page. .
- if i am generating leads. i need the visitor to fill in a form. Email usually.

this will help with the layout of the page. and pop ups.

## 3. Where am i advertising?

Have you ever search for something on google. clicked on the search result. and went back after seeing the landing page for 5-6 seconds ?. the page did not answer you immediately!

This is crucial. you have to work on the congruency.

Show the user what he came for exactly on the first seconds he lands on your page !

If i search "Home made skin care" and i click on a website and the title says "Top 10 Skin Care Products" i am leaving immediately. the important keyword here is "Home Made" or "Do It Yourself".

If i clicked on a Facebook ad that says "Do this to keep your hair from falling" i am expecting to find the same words on the title ! as soon as i land on your page.

## 4. What types of Landing Page will work?

Successful affiliate marketers have many things in common. the most important one you will keep hearing and i can not stop emphasizing is **Testing**.

Depending on the product, the vendor, and the platform you are buying traffic from. a landing page with a Quiz may convert more than a simple PreLander. that does not engage the user and requires action.

## 5. Sell the feeling

A: Why did you buy it ?

B: I liked it.

[Harvard Professor](https://www.inc.com/logan-chierotti/harvard-professor-says-95-of-purchasing-decisions-are-subconscious.html) Says 95% of Purchasing Decisions Are Subconscious.

When marketing a product to a consumer, it's most effective to target the subconscious mind.

If you are selling a WiFi Range Extender. nobody wants to hear about the technical stuff and how it has a specific broadcast (product label tells this) !

just tell me i will enjoy **WiFi in my basement**. i'd like to have strong WiFi signal in my basement.

> At least 1 of the landing pages you are going to test should be sentimental

**Test, Test, Test**

You never know what landing page will work for you unless you **test it**. but with some experience you can narrow the test subjects to 2 or 3 landers.

## Personal Experience:

> This may not work for you. do not take it for granted.

As of today. this is how i decide on my landing pages style to test.

Starting with the advertising platform. this has a huge impact on the decision. building pages for google search ads is different from promoting on facebook ads.

**Native Ads** : your target is on a website like [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/). he clicks on your ads and get redirected to your landing page.

The average user does not suspect this is an advertorial and he was redirected outside the official website.

you have to keep the same user experience. and use an Advertorial landing page style. and make it look like a news article.

If your landing page is spamming the reader. he will leave.

You can also use a Presell page with native ads. just make it look clean. with a nice title. and an intriguing description the user would like to know the rest of the story.

**Search Ads** : both Bing and Google allow you to run search ads campaigns. the main thing to focus on when building your landing page for search ads is the Title.

your target clicked on your site after searching google. you better have what he searched for on the TITLE.

if you are doing a product review. do not be afraid to show it as the first thing. You are not spamming.
the customer knows the product and is looking for a review.

**Social Ads** : if you are using a social network. keep the same style.

Do not take people from watching to reading straight.

if i am watching a YouTube video. i am in the mood for a video. maybe i can't read right now.

if you use instagram (you should) keep it straight forward. i clicked on a Hiking Backpack. show me what's interesting about it. and how it helps me when hiking.

i already liked the photo and clicked on it. i just need a small push to buy it.

## Conclusion

the one and only correct answer to what landing page converts is **"The one you tested"**

First. decide on what type of landing page you are building. Advertorial, Presell, or Product info page.

Do not copy other people. Inspire from successful pages.

What works for them. may not work for you. they tested a lot before settling on the one you are copying.

Keep it congruent. titles should matches. original website style should match.

Second. build at least 2 different landing pages that are congruent with the ads platform as we said before.

Third. Start Testing what landing page works, what is repulsing users. and what is driving them from point A to B.

If you feel like there's something i missed. or i am wrong about. do tell me in the comments. and thank you for reading.

Everyone can run a campaign on their favorite advertisement platform. and start bringing people to their landing page. other affiliates relie on SEO to bring organic traffic.

but only few visitors turn to a client. the majority does not **Convert**. because the landing page did not sell them.

i am talking precisely about affiliate marketing landing pages. because they go wrong easily. one malformed heading will send the visitor away.

## What are landing pages?

When a visitor clicks on your ad (for example, a Google ad or facebook ad). he will be redirected to your website. the first page he sees is called a Landing Page.

Specific landing pages tailored to different offers are essential for providing a quality experience for visitors.

a targeted message that matches each userâ€™s need will likely .

These are the steps i follow whenever i am making a landing page for my affiliate websites.

the better you understand your audience, the more you can answer to their questions.

Unless you know who your ideal customers are, it will be very difficult to write content they are interested in ! and keep them on the page.

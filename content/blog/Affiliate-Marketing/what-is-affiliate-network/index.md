An affiliate network acts as an intermediary between publishers and merchant affiliate programs. It allows website publishers to more easily find and participate in affiliate programs which are suitable. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affiliate_network)

An affiliate network connects publishers, like blog owners or influencers, with companies looking to promote their products or services.

These networks often offer reporting tools, training, and other resources to help you become a successful affiliate marketer.

The most popular example of an affiliate network is Amazon, which allows publishers and influencers to promote thousands of products and earn a commission for each purchase their readers or followers make.

## How do affiliate networks work?

For an affiliate network to work, both advertisers and publishers must first sign up to the network.  Once accepted, advertisers can add their programs to the network, and publishers have immediate access to a lot of affiliate programs and promotional materials.

Affiliate networks work as a marketplace for affiliate programs. Publishers or site owners sign up, choose the products or services they want to promote and receive custom links that track how many people purchase from their sites. Then, they are paid a commission (usually % of the sale) for each sale.

Publishers can fill out an application to join any program they want to promote. once they've been accepted as an advertiser's affiliate partner They have access to a wide range of promotional texts or creatives that can be used on a variety of platforms, including social media, emails, and websites.

When a publisher joins the affiliate network, they are given a unique publisher ID -discount code, coupons, but mostly referrals links- which is used to track sales for each program advertised on the network.

The publisher places the affiliate links across social networks and different websites; when potential customers click on the link, they are then taken to the advertiser’s website to complete their purchase.

The ID is tracked by the affiliate network so that the sale can be attributed to the publisher. The publishers and advertisers can access their dashboard at any time and review all aspects of the program within the affiliate network’s platform.

## Why pick affiliate network over direct affiliate marketing?

Advertisers can approach or seek publishers directly to promote their products, but using an affiliate network is generally more straightforward and secure. Many aspects of running an affiliate program are handled by an affiliate network, giving you more time to focus on other aspects of your business.

Benefits of using an affiliate network include:

- **1. Managed affiliate solution**

Managing all aspects of an affiliate program can be difficult because there are so many variables involved. Account management, technology, and end-to-end tracking are all provided by an affiliate network, which streamlines the process. It also has payment and reporting options, resulting in a system that is simple to track, monitor, and tweak.

- **2. Getting the most out of your advertising budget**

Advertisers typically pay a commission when a sale is made, and this sale also triggers the affiliate network's fee, which is commonly referred to as the network fee or override. This is usually calculated as a percentage of the sale or a commission, depending on the terms of the agreement with each advertiser. Most networks, on the other hand, can be flexible with their payment models to ensure that the affiliate marketing channel is performing optimally.

- **3. Your products are only promoted by approved publishers**

Publishers must apply to join affiliate networks, and each advertiser program must go through an approval process. Because not everyone is accepted, your products are only promoted by publishers who the network has identified as potential good partners for their advertisers.

Offering your affiliate program directly requires you to find suitable publishers to promote your product and approach each one individually, which takes time and effort.

- **4. Sales tracking all in one place**

Affiliate networks provide you with a comprehensive dashboard that allows you to track impressions, clicks, conversions, and, most importantly, sales and revenue, and generate reports at any time. You can keep track of which publishers are the most successful, as well as which campaigns are a success.

- **5. It works**

With 81 percent of brands using affiliate marketing, it's clear that despite claims from across the digital industry that it's dying, this marketing channel is still growing in popularity. Kevin Edwards, Global Strategy Director, addresses this notion, but it's clear that an industry that accounts for 16 percent of e-commerce sales and has a 10-percent annual growth rate is as strong as ever. The affiliate marketing industry now has over two decades of data to back up the simple fact that affiliate marketing through a dedicated network is a profitable endeavor.

## Top Affiliate Networks in 2021

Type in “affiliate networks” into Google, and you’ll see hundreds of platforms to choose from — some legit and others that look a little bit shady.

So how do you choose the right one?

Start by considering your audience. What types of products and services are your readers likely to be interested in?

For example, digital marketers are more likely to be interested in SEO tools than women’s fashion, so I might choose an affiliate platform that can connect me with online tools and marketing analytic platforms.

When comparing the top affiliate networks, there are a few other factors to consider:

- **Commission rates**: How much will you earn per sale? Networks can vary widely.
- **Product/service selection**: Will the network connect you with brands your audience will be interested in?
- **Approval requirements**: Some networks require your site to be well-established or have a certain amount of traffic.
- **Other fees**: Some affiliate networks charge fees for training or setup.
- **Cookie duration**: Cookie duration refers to how long a program tracks and gives you credit for a prospective buyer. Durations can vary drastically from platform to platform. For example, Amazon’s cookie duration is 24 hours, while Avangate is 120 days

Now that you know what to look for — and what to avoid — let’s explore some of the top affiliate marketing networks.

- **ShareASale**

This Chicago-based affiliate network has been around since 2000. As a ShareASale affiliate, you can connect with more than 4,000 programs and earn commissions on a wide range of products, including Reebok, Cricut, and Etsy.

- **Awin**

Awin is a global affiliate network platform with access to more than 15,000 advertisers, and they helped generate more than 150 million in sales in 2019 alone. It’s also worth noting they own several other affiliate networks, including ShareASale, though those networks have their own sites.

- **Amazon Associates**

Probably the best-known affiliate network is Amazon Associates. As the largest e-commerce store globally, Amazon provides access to millions of products from baby gear to home goods, makeup, and much more.

- **CJ Affiliate**

Formerly known as Commission Junction, CJ Affiliate is one of the world’s largest and oldest affiliate marketing networks. They connect merchants with more than 14 billion readers annually and help affiliate marketers earn more than $1.8 billion every year.

- **Rakuten Advertising**

Founded as a Japanese e-commerce brand, Rakuten Advertising is home to one of the top affiliate marketing networks. They provide affiliates access to hundreds of top brands, including Wells Fargo, Lilly Pulitzer, Virgin Holidays, and Ecco.

- **ClickBank**

ClickBank is a global affiliate marketing platform providing access to a wide range of products you can promote, including physical and digital ones.

Overall, ClickBank is easy to join and provides access to a wide range of products. However, be sure to check out products before you promote them—not all available products are of high quality. Their free training resources are also a bit limited, though they offer a paid training platform called ClickBank University.

## Conclusion

One of the most effective ways to monetize your blog is through affiliate marketing. An affiliate network makes connecting with merchants much easier, allowing you to focus on what you do best: creating great content.

Juggling dozens of merchants and programs, on the other hand, can be a pain. Also, make certain to read the fine print. Not all affiliate networks are trustworthy, and even well-known brands may not carry the products your target market wants.

Now that you know what <a href="/nfts/what-is-nft/"> NFTs </a> are. it is time to start digging and get familiar with the market. in this short article i will show you how much people are willing to spend for an Original art. and why it concerns you.

## NFT market is on fire

First, let me tell you that the market is on fire. Someone paid almost $390,000 for a <a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x948b3515d81034a3c16d5393c6c155946c93c103/1" target="_blank"> 50-second video by Grimes</a> . another person paid $6.6 million for a video by Beeple. yes ! 6.6 Million Dollars for this

The work, titled CROSSROADS, was created by Beeple considering the 2020 US Presidential elections.a dummy figure resembling Trump lying naked on the sidewalk. On its body, one can view various terms and phrases like ‚Äòloser‚Äô, ‚ÄòMAGA‚Äô and ‚Äòdrink bleach‚Äô.

The artwork is NFT (or non-fungible token) ‚Äì which means that the original copy cannot be copied or counterfeited in any possible way. In the world of digital art, Beeple is a well-recognized name. Just in December last year, his sales over the weekend accounted for $3.5 million. This, despite the fact that the artist rarely offers his works for auction.

The buyer interest in NFT has reached new heights over last year. The NFT Report 2020 said that the year saw a total of $250 million worth of NFT being sold.Most works at the Nifty Gateways auction were bought within few minutes of the auction <strong>and then re-sold sometime later at inflated prices</strong>.

## What‚Äôs the point?

Depends ! maybe you just like having unique things. but first let me ask you

## Are you an Artist ?

You might be interested in NFTs because it gives you a way to sell work that there otherwise might not be much of a market for. if you are an Artist with a big audience. chances are higher that you can create NFTs and sell them. if you have an Engaging Audience. traders like me might buy your digital art and resell it. it is a win-win situation.

Also, NFTs have a feature that you can enable that will pay you a percentage every time the NFT is sold or changes hands, making sure that if your work gets super popular and balloons in value, you‚Äôll see some of that benefit. Passive Income Baby !

## Are you a Buyer ?

Buying art lets you financially support artists you like just like buying Merch. but buying an NFT also usually gets you some basic usage rights, like being able to post the image online or set it as your profile picture. Plus, of course, there are bragging rights that you own the art, with a blockchain entry to back it up.

## Oh. You're a Collector

well the NFT world might be the best for you because of the variety. NFTs can work like any other speculative asset, where you buy it and hope that the value of it goes up one day, so you can sell it for a profit.

## There is only one ?

technicaly.every NFT is a unique token on the blockchain. But while it could be like a van Gogh, where there‚Äôs only one definitive actual version, it could also be like a trading card, where there‚Äôs 50 or hundreds of numbered copies of the same artwork.

## Someone is willing to pay thousands for it ?

Absolutely. to some people . NFTs are the future of fine art collecting. others treat them like Pok√©mon cards. and if there is someone willing to pay for it. there is a guy like me and you taking the opportunity to Trade and make profit.

## Famous Collectibles
